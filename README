# Image-SuperResolution

This repo contains relevant material along with the code for our project on Image Super Resolution. The project was done as a part of the course AI5100: Deep Learning, Fall 2023 at IIT Hyderabad under the guidance of [Prof. Sumohana Channappayya](https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/).

## Abstract
We aim to study the problem of Image Super Resolution (SR) and implement a few of the state-of-the-art methods on medical images. We also aim to explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for the task of SR.
